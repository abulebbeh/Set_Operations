# Set Operations in Java

This project is a simple Java program that demonstrates how to perform basic set operations. 
The program takes two sets of integers as input (comma or space separated) and outputs the results of the following operations:

- Absolute Complement of S (with respect to the universal set {1, 2, …, 100})
- Difference (S - T)
- Union (S ∪ T)
- Intersection (S ∩ T)
- Power Set of S (all possible subsets of S)
- Cartesian Product of S and T (all ordered pairs (s, t))

The goal of this project is to practice working with sets, loops, and fundamental algorithms in Java. 
It’s intended as a beginner-friendly example for learning set theory concepts through programming.
